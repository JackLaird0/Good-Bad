	<h3> Comprehensive Wing Guide (Opinion)</h3>
	<p class="three"> You truly cannot go wrong with any of the wing flavors above but with an amazing buy one get one deal you might as well choose multiple flavors. I personally love the Mango Habanero flavor, it's sweet, savory, and hot enough to make you sweat. I get this wing every time but it is important to compliment it with a lighter flavor like Teriyaki or Parmesean Garlic. If you're feeling bold you can go a little hotter with your second wing flavor, I suggest Asian Zing or Caribbean Jerk, but make sure to get some potato wedges to help offset the heat. Remember the more wings you get, the more sauces you're allowed to choose from, so go big or go home. The world is truly your oyster at BWW.</p>
